## <p align="center">⛈️Weather Forecast⛈️</p>

## Overview
- Created a weather application where users can see a 5 day forecast of the temperature, humidity and windspeed. 
- Used HTML, CSS, Javascript and APIs

### Description
Any users who decide to use this application will be able to input any city to find out their forecast. Users can search for example Toronto, New York, Vietnam etc, does not matter where they are they can get that daily 5 day forecast.

Not only will it show the 5 day forecast but they will also be able to see the weather icon which indicates if it's sunny, night-time, snowing, raining and so on.

The following criteria was given when implementing this application:

- GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
- WHEN I search for a city
- THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
- WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
- THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
- WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
- THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
- WHEN I click on a city in the search history
- THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

## Future Goals
This web application is still a work in progress, working on having the search bar appear at the top rather than the bottom when it enters a certain size aswell as displaying the title to stay aligned in the center.
