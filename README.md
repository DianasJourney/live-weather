## Overview
- Created a weather application where users can see a 5 day forecast of the temperature, humidity and windspeed. 
- Used HTML, CSS, Javascript and APIs

### Description
- GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
- WHEN I search for a city
- THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
- WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
- THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
- WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
- THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
- WHEN I click on a city in the search history
